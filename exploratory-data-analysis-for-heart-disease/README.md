# Exploratory Data Analysis for Heart Disease
__Libraries:__ tidyverse, ggplot2, corrplot

In this project I examine a dataset for heart disease, using various data analysis techniques such as PCA, feature correlation and skewness. The dataset provides information about hundreds of patient's health and whether they have heart disease.

The dataset used is stored in this repository, but can also be found on Kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci
