# Visualising Significant Global Earthquakes
__Libraries:__ tidyverse, ggplot2

In this project, I use ggplot2 to map out all earthquakes of magnitude 5.5+ across the globe between 1965 to 2015, particularly looking at countries that suffer the most earthquakes.

The datasets used are stored in this repository, but can also be found on Kaggle here:
