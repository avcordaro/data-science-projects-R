# Data Science Independent Projects - R
A portfolio of my independent data science projects using R, involving data analysis and visualisation. Libraries used include tidyverse and ggplot2.

The list of projects is as follows:

* __Visualising Significant Global Earthquakes__ - mapping out earthquakes of magnitude 5.5+ across the globe between 1965 to 2015, particularly looking at countries that suffer the most earthquakes.
