# Data Science Independent Projects - R
A portfolio of my independent data science projects using R, involving data analysis and visualisation. Libraries used include tidyverse and ggplot2.

The list of projects is as follows:

* __Credit Card Fraud Detection__ - attempting to build models which can detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset contains information about thousands of transactions, with a heavy imbalance towards non-fraudulent cases. 

* __Exploratory Data Analysis for Heart Disease__ - examining a heart disease dataset, using various data analysis techniques such as PCA, feature correlation and skewness. The dataset provides information about hundreds of patient's health and whether they have heart disease.

* __Sentiment Analysis of Google Play Store App Reviews__ - performing sentiment analysis on user reviews for apps on the Google Play Store, looking at the overall positive/neutral/negative sentiment for the reviews, as well as frequently used words.

* __Visualising Significant Global Earthquakes__ - mapping out earthquakes of magnitude 5.5+ across the globe between 1965 to 2015, particularly looking at countries that suffer the most earthquakes.
