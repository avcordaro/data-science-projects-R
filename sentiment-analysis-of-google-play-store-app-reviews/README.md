# Sentiment Analysis of Google Play Store App Reviews
__Libraries:__ tidyverse, tidytext, wordcloud, ggplot2

In this project, I perform sentiment analysis on user reviews for apps on the Google Play Store, looking at the overall positive/neutral/negative sentiment for the reviews, as well as frequently used words.

The dataset used is stored in this repository, but can also be found on Kaggle here:
