# Credit Card Fraud Detection
__Libraries:__ tidyverse, xgboost, lightgbm, randomForest, ggplot2

In this project I look at building models which can detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset contains information about thousands of transactions, with a heavy imbalance towards non-fraudulent cases. 

The dataset used is too large to be stored in this repository, but can be found on Kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
